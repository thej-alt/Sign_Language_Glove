# âœ‹ Sign Language Recognition Glove  

The **Sign Language Recognition Glove** is an Arduino-based project that translates hand gestures into text for real-time communication between sign language users and non-signers. This project uses flex sensors, MPU6050, and wireless communication modules to capture and process gestures.

## Android App

Receives data via Bluetooth (HC-05)

Displays recognized gestures in text form

User-friendly UI for real-time communication

---
## Workflow

Wear the glove with sensors.

Flex sensors + accelerometer capture gesture data.

Arduino processes values and sends them over Bluetooth.

Android app receives data and displays the recognized gesture as text.

Follow these steps to run the project:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Sign-Language-Glove.git
cd Sign-Language-Glove

# 2. Open the code
# Open src/main.ino in Arduino IDE or VS Code (with Arduino extension)

# 3. Install dependencies
# - Arduino IDE (latest)
# - Required Libraries:
#   * SoftwareSerial
#   * Wire
#   * ESP8266WiFi (if using Wi-Fi)
#   * Any sensor-specific libraries

# 4. Connect hardware
# - Flex sensors to Arduino analog pins
# - HC-05 (TX/RX) or ESP8266 for wireless communication
# - Power up the glove

# 5. Upload code
# Select the correct Arduino board & COM port, then upload src/main.ino

# 6. Test
# Open Serial Monitor or connect via Bluetooth/Wi-Fi to see gesture outputs

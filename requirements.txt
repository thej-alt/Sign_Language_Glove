1. Hardware Requirements : 

Arduino Board: 
             Arduino UNO / Arduino NANO (ATmega328P-based).

Sensors:
             Flex Sensors (for finger bending detection).
             Accelerometer (ADXL335/ADXL345) for motion/orientation tracking.

Communication Module: 
             Bluetooth HC-05 (Master/Slave mode).

Power Supply: 
             9V Battery (with battery snap & regulator if required)

Other Components: 
             Breadboard / PCB (for circuit connections).
             Jumper Wires (male-to-male, male-to-female).
             A Glove (base for mounting sensors).


2. Software Requirements:
             Arduino IDE (for coding and uploading sketches to Arduino)

Programming Language:
             Arduino C/C++

Gesture Recognition Algorithm:
             Custom logic based on flex + accelerometer data

Android App:
             Developed in Android Studio (Java/Kotlin).
             Bluetooth API for communication with HC-05.
             Real-time display of recognized gestures.


3. Communication Requirements:

Protocol: 
             Serial Bluetooth Communication (UART)

Baud Rate: 
             9600 bps (standard for HC-05, configurable)

Data Format: 
             ASCII/UTF-8 encoded gesture data sent from Arduino â†’ Android App



4. Functional Requirements:
             Arduino reads data from flex sensors + accelerometer.
             Data is processed using a gesture recognition algorithm.
             A recognized gesture is sent via the HC-05 Bluetooth module.
             Android app receives and displays the corresponding gesture meaning (e.g., text or speech).
